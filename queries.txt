"Then just review what you learned in high school. You''ll be fine." Now, in high school, I took AP Physics in 11th grade.
And in 12th grade, I took another physics course that went into much more advanced stuff based on multivariable calculus.

There are an uncountable amount of stars in the sky, and on one night, they all aligned, and that was the night I was born. Now I’m not a narcissist, but I have to recognize that I’m one of the greatest human beings ever born.
Amen!
And being gifted by the heavens, by my friends, by my environment, has really taught me something. Do you know what it taught me? It taught me every single one of you is valuable. But none of you is more valuable than [sic] me. 
Think of it. This is the zero value point. I’m like up here, this is a limit. You guys are somewhere around here. 
Thank you for listening guys. You are all valuable in your own ways. Have a wonderful day everybody."', 'Booyya''s Birthday Speech //mod note: why was this submitted as a google doc', 'booyya,math_phys,');

Dear class,

Until further notice I have none of the files I have been using for class available to me. Everything for all my classes is on a purple flashdrive that I have been keeping in a nondescript white envelope folded into thirds with a clip on it. This flashdrive has been misplaced, so every Powerpoint, Word document, or other file associated with all my classes is lost until further notice. I did not back up these files.

The good news is, I am willing to copy, at the expense of Montgomery County Public Schools, one of these for you. It is [also] on the inside cover of your textbook, however it is a pain in the butt to flip back and forth when you''re doing your homework. If you lose [the copy], it is easy to find it. Just google image search "Standard Normal Probability Table", and you too can print out one of these. It''s not a secret. That''s the good news.
Stein: The bad news is I don''t call it the "Standard Normal Probability Table", and what I''m about to tell you is probably the most annoying thing you''ll hear from me the whole year, and you''re going to hear it over and over again until you can''t stand it, because I call this thing the "CH-A-R-A-R-A-RT" *shouts in crazy fluctuating/yodeling tone*, like that.
// students laugh
Stein: Now, there''s no reason for that. I''ve been doing it for probably twelve years, since I started teaching statistics. You can''t stop me. I know it''s annoying and I continue to do it, so there''s nothing you can do about it. And probably in about ten minutes you''re going to be sick of hearing about the "CH-A-R-A-R-A-RT", but there''s nothing you can do about it and just think how you''re going to feel in January. After every time you got this piece of paper out, the stupid teacher goes "CH-A-R-A-R-A-RT" and nobody knows why. And what makes it even stupider is this is not even a chart. It''s a table, so there''s no reason behind why I call it the "CH-A-R-A-R-A-RT".
Stein: Now first of all, there are two sides to it. Do you see the column that says "z"? One side has positive z and the other side has negative z. Now, you might think to yourself, being a smart person...
Students: ...self...
Stein: Thank you... it''s symmetric, so you don''t really need both sides, right?
Students: Right.
Stein: And in fact, I learned this when I was tutoring a kid who was doing IB. In Europe, they only give you one side. And you can do the problems just fine with only one side, but there''s a reason why Europe is in decline and the United States is the greatest country on Earth. And one of the reasons why the United States is the greatest country on Earth and Europe is in decline is that we have both sides because we''re Americans, and we don''t need both sides but damn it, we get both sides!', 'September 10, 2010 - Magnet Applied Statistics - Standard Normal Probability Table Lecture', 'america,americans,chart,europe,probability,standard,states,table,united,magnet,stein,statistics,normal,');

Later, I woke up, and saw that I had been drooling. Like, reeeeaally drooling. And I looked at my watch, and noticed I was 10 minutes late for class. And then I noticed there were a bunch of legs all around me, and realized they were having a meeting, and they didn''t know I was under here. So I was thinking, "Oh my god, what do I do, I can''t just skip class," and so I crawled out from under the table - and I was about 30, y''know - and all the people just stared at me.
